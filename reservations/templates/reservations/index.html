      <p>Welcome to The Blue Boar Inn, a traditional restaurant nestled deep in the heart of the English countryside.
      </p>
      <p>Records show an inn on this site since at least the 14th century. It is believed our name may well have been
        inspired by the personal heraldy of the Earls of Oxford and Henry VII may well have stayed here on the way to
        his coronation. The present building dates from the 17th Century after the original was destroyed in the civil
        war. </p>
