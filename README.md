### Database Schema

The Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) below were prepared prior to development.

#### Reservation model ERD

The reservation_time and number_of_guests fields are set to choices (providing users witha fixed number of input choices) rather than TimeField or NumField inputs. This was the most straightforward way of presenting the user with limited inputs preventing them booking outside opening hours or booking for too many guests.

#### Menu model ERD

menu_entry_type provides the user with a choice between Starter, Main, Dessert or Drinks for their entry, corresponding with a section on the menu page on the site.

Please note that in both cases the user wasn't set to ondelete (i.e. any entries by the user being deleted if their user profile is deleted) as I wanted staff to be able to set reservations for customers and add to the menu. Staff turnover can be high in the hospitality sector and I wanted restaurant managers to be able to delete staff profiles without deleting data entries they had made.



### Testing
Both manual and automated tests were used in the testing of the programme.
